            In the Bible God says ‘I will make your name great’ and today the name of Abraham/Abram
             is known worldwide. This promise has come true. The earliest copy of Genesis found in the Dead 
             Sea Scrolls is dated 200-100 B.C. which means the promise has been in writing since at least 
             that time. At that time the <sp style="color: brown;">name of Abraham was not well-known so the promise came true only
              after it was written down,</sp> not before.
